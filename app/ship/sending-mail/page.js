                Step 1: Choose Envelope or Postcard
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                Envelopes are for sending flat, flexible things, like letters,
                cards, checks, forms, and other paper goods. For just 1 $0.73
                First-Class Mail® Forever® stamp, you can send 1 oz (about 4
                sheets of regular, 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quote; paper in a
                rectangular envelope) to anywhere in the U.S.!
              </p>
              <p>
                Envelopes must be rectangular and made of paper to qualify for
                letter prices. Your envelope can be a maximum of 11-1/2&quot;
                long x 6-1/8&quot; high. (A standard No. 10 envelope is
                9-1/2&quot; long x 4-1/8&quot; high.) You can fold what you put
                in your envelope, but it needs to stay flat—no more than
                1/4&quot; thick. <br /> If you want to send letter-sized papers
                without folding them, you can use a large envelope (called a
                &quot;flat&quot;); the postage for flats starts at $1.50. If
                your large envelope is nonrectangular, rigid (can&apos;t bend),
                or lumpy (not uniformly thick), you&apos;ll have to pay the
                package price.
                <br /> <b>TIP:</b> If your envelope can&apos;t fit through
                Krest Delivery mail processing machines, or is rigid, lumpy or has
                clasps, string, or buttons, it&apos;s &quot;nonmachinable&quot;
                and you&apos;ll have to pay $0.46 more to send it. (See
                additional postage in Step 3.) You&apos;ll also have to pay more
                if your envelopes are square or vertical (taller than they are
                wide).
                <br /> <b>Postcards </b>
                are for short messages that you don&apos;t need to put in an
                envelope. Save money using a $0.56 postcard stamp to send a
                standard-sized postcard anywhere in the U.S. Standard postcards
                are usually made of paper, are between 5&quot; to 6&quot; long
                and 3-1/2&quot; to 4-1/4&quot; high, and are between 0.007&quot;
                and 0.016&quot; thick.

                Envelopes: Write your address (the &quot;return&quot; or

                delivery address (the &quot;recipient&quot; address) in the

              </h3>
              <p className="mb-2">
                A First-Class Mail® Forever stamp costs $0.73 and goes in the
                upper right corner of the envelope. (You can also use any
                combination of stamps that adds up to $0.73.) If your letter is
                heavier or bigger, or if you want to add insurance or extra
                services like Certified Mail® service, you&apos;ll pay more. A
                standard postcard stamp costs $0.56. (Large or square postcards
                will cost more.) Put the postcard stamp in the space provided
                near the delivery address.

                Once your envelope or postcard has the correct addresses and
